# Data-Cleaning-Regression-Analysis-and-Model-Evaluation-with-SMOTE
This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a business dataset, applying various regression models, and handling class imbalance using SMOTE to ensure robust predictions and insights.

Project Workflow:
- Data Cleaning: Preprocessed the dataset by addressing missing values, outliers, and ensuring consistency to create a reliable data foundation.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted a comprehensive analysis using visualizations and statistical summaries to identify trends, correlations, and patterns within the data.
- SMOTE Implementation: Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to handle imbalanced data, ensuring that the regression models can perform well across both majority and minority classes.

Regression Modeling:
-  Linear Regression: Modeled the relationship between variables using this straightforward yet powerful method.
-  Decision Tree Regression: Used this non-linear algorithm to capture complex patterns and interactions in the data.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluated the performance of both models using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and RÂ² to determine their predictive capabilities and accuracy.
- Variable Importance: Determined which variables significantly impact the target variable, offering actionable insights for business improvement.
- Predictive Modeling: Leveraged the models to forecast future outcomes, providing practical use cases in real-world business scenarios.

Key Features:
- SMOTE for Class Imbalance: Ensured balanced representation of classes to improve model performance.
- Multiple Regression Models: Compared Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regression for better insights.
- Model Performance Evaluation: Comprehensive evaluation of model performance using relevant metrics.
- Business Insights: Extracted meaningful insights from data to support strategic decision-making.

Results:
Improved model performance after applying SMOTE to address class imbalance.
Identified important variables influencing the target, leading to actionable business insights.
Achieved more accurate predictions by comparing and selecting the best-fit model.
